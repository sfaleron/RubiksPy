Requirements
------------

* Python v2.x, x>=6
  http://www.python.org/

* VisualPython
  http://www.vpython.org/
  The last release of v5 or any v6 should work. Needs confirmation.

* NumPy
  http://www.numpy.org/
  Is included with VisualPython under Windows.


Getting Started
---------------
Once the requirements are installed, invoke ``rubiks.pyw`` with the Python interpreter. Usually, double-clicking on the file in the customary fashion accomplishes this.
For the command-line users out there::

 python2 rubiks.pyw

There are helpful comments at the top of ``rubiks.pyw``. I'll improve on that as time goes by.


Known Issues
------------
* I haven't reproduced it recently, but sometimes a random series of turns does not reverse correctly.
* Not all the keybindings work.
* Poor documentation!
